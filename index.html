      <h2>Block by block.</h2>
      <p>Pixel art is a form of digital art that is created in a very low resolution and usually consists of large pixels.
        It can be used in video games, animations, and other multimedia projects. The process for creating pixel artwork usually involves the artist using software to create images with small blocks of color or pixels. Pixel art is great because it allows for more creativity with the colors and shapes, without worrying about precision of ones brush strokes. It has a retro feel to it that some people really enjoy and also has a lot of nostalgia associated with it, as many video games were created using pixel art in the past.</p>
        <h2>Creativity through limitations.</h2>
        <p>There are limitations on what can be created with pixel art, but it is exactly these limitations that push the creativity further! Due to the limited resolution each pixel is an important choice, one that can make a difference between a great and a mediocre artwork. This is why in pixel a pixel can mean more than just a color on a certain point of the screen. A single pixel can be a nose, a button, a sharp edge of a blade!</p>
        <h2>A Gateway.</h2>
        <p>Pixel art is an amazing way to express yourself and create your own style of art without having to spend as much time and resources. From characters, to scenery, to abstract pieces, pixel art can be anything you want it to be. This is why many indie developers opt for this style, as they can create video games without the need of a team of artists</p>
